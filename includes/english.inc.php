	<p align=\"justify\">

	<b>How to assign a ticket to your friend?</b><br>
	Please click on the green arrow in the column assignment and use the form to
	find your friend and make the assignment.
	</p>

	<b>Is my reservation binding and can I change or cancel it?</b><br>
	No, your reservation is not legally binding and you can change oder delete your order before you have
	paid it. Your reservations gets legally binding after we received your payment and then you may reserve your seat.
	</p>

	<p align=\"justify\">
	<b>I have already paid but my reservation was cancelled in the meantime</b><br>
	In this case your reservation will be re-activated if there are enough tickets left.
	</p>

	<p align=\"justify\">
	<b>Is the payment period changing?</b><br>
	The payment period depends on how many ticket are available. When ticket availability is going down,
	payment periods are shorted. You shall alway have a look at your payment period because it may change.
	The best possibility is to pay directly after reserving.</p>

	<p align=\"justify\">
	<b>I can assign a person only once as ticket-user. Why?</b><br>
	Our system doesn't imply that every ticket gets allocated to its final user at the party.
	To make this sure to the ticket holder (buyer) right from the start, only one ticket can be allocated to each user.
	This increases the allocation quota and greatly reduces mistakes in the allocations. All this helps speeding up the admission.
	That means it is not possible for one person to manage all tickets from different buyers.
	If you want only one person to manage all tickets, then all these tickets have to be purchased by this person.
	There will be no special arrangements for tickets that are signed over belatedly.
	</p>

	<p align=\"justify\">
	<b>I have already paid but I won't be able to visit the party. Can I get my money back?</b><br>
	Your reservation is legally binding after paying it and returning is not possible.
	But you can feel free to ask us in a good manner. Sometimes we cancel your order and
	send back your money less 5 EUR handling fee.
	Because this is a complex administration, please try first to find someone for yourself to transfer
	your ticket to.
	Gettin money back is impossible if this is requested later than 14 days before the event.
